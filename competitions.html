                <p>This is the flagship competition of our club. It is the one competition that 
                    truly determines the level of each individual golfers game. It is played 
                    in a strokeplay format and is made up of seven individual games played throughout the year.
                    Of the seven games played for each golfer we take the best five scores and 
                    the golfer with, accumulatively, least number of strokes is our champion 
                    golfer of the year.<br><br>
                    The reigning RGC OOM champion is <i><b>Soso Mokhoka</b></i>, seen in above picture posing with the 
                    championship trophy and four other trophies he won in our monthly OOM/IPS games.

                    games played over a year. Of the four separate games, we take the best three  
                    of the four scores for each golfer and the golfer with the most points accumulated 
                    from his three best scores is declared the champion golfer for the event for the year.

                <p>At its inception this competition was hosted by the late Tubatsana Monareng and 
                    the competition has since been renamed Tubatsana Monareng Memorial Whisky Competion, 
                    in honour and remembrance of our fallen fellow golfer and friend. Tubs, as he was 
                    popularly known, held many executive positions in the club, including Captain and Chairman.<br> 
                    The annual competition is played in IPS format and is a once-off event. The winner on the 
                    day is the champion golfer for the event. To take part every participant brings a 12 year 
                    old whisky bottle, the preferred brands being Glenlivet and Glenfiddich.<br>
                    We have up to five prizes on the day (top 5), distributing the donated bottles 
                    to the top five golfers and the rest of the bottles are consumed at the 19th hole.
